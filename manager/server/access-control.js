/**
 * Source-restricts the manager's HTTP API to whatever fronts it with Umbrel's
 * single sign-on.
 *
 * The manager listens on 0.0.0.0 on Umbrel's shared app network, where every
 * installed app can reach it by name/IP. Only the component that fronts the
 * browser with single sign-on should ever call the manager: it terminates the
 * browser connection and opens a fresh proxied connection, so legitimate
 * requests arrive with that component's own address as their TCP source. This
 * guard rejects any request whose source is not that component or loopback, so
 * a co-installed (or compromised) app on the shared network cannot drive the
 * wallet API (including the fund-moving proxied daemon routes) directly,
 * bypassing the sign-on.
 *
 * That component depends on the umbrelOS version:
 *  - Legacy Umbrel and umbrelOS 1.x run an app_proxy container per app. It is
 *    resolved by Docker DNS and re-resolved periodically because its IP can
 *    change across restarts; {all:true} captures every network the container
 *    is on, so whichever IP the connection actually uses is covered.
 *  - umbrelOS 2 removed that container: umbreld's app gateway, on the host,
 *    connects straight to this container's IP, so its requests come from the
 *    Docker bridge host. That address is the gateway of the container's
 *    default route, read from /proc/net/route. The rbitcoin settings service
 *    trusts the same address for the same reason.
 * Both are trusted on every system. On the older ones the bridge host is only
 * Umbrel itself, which owns the app's data anyway, and apps that share the
 * host's network.
 *
 * It leans on the real TCP peer (req.socket.remoteAddress), never a spoofable
 * X-Forwarded-For header.
 *
 * Safeguards against ever locking the user out of their own wallet:
 *  - Set BEIGNET_TRUST_ALL=1 to disable the guard entirely.
 *  - Until the guard knows which of the two fronts this box, it fails open
 *    (allows) so a transient DNS problem cannot brick the dashboard. It knows
 *    once app_proxy resolves, or once Docker DNS answers for this container's
 *    own name but not for app_proxy, which means there is no app_proxy here.
 *  - A request from an unknown source re-resolves before it is refused, so an
 *    app_proxy that starts after the manager is let in on its first request.
 *
 * `guard.strict` is the same guard without the fail-open window, for routes
 * where failing open is the worse outcome: an unresolved app_proxy costs a
 * dashboard feature, where a bulk seed export to a co-installed app costs the
 * coins. It admits loopback, a resolved app_proxy and the bridge host, nothing
 * else.
