/**
 * Run with: npm test (from manager/).
 *
 * After a restart the app's Tor needs time to bootstrap and upload the onion's
 * descriptor, and its own connections to the onion can keep failing for a few
 * minutes after that however healthy Tor is. The manager used to probe once
 * at 90 s and then every five minutes, so one early failure kept the "cannot
 * build circuits" warning up for minutes. These pin down when TorHealth lets
 * a probe run and what a result does to the verdict.
